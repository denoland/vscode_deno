## Prerequisites

Most changes & feature enhancements don't require the extension to be
modified, as the majority of the data used in the extension is supplied by
the **Deno Language Server** which is integrated into the **[Deno CLI]**.

<br>

If you already have this VSCode extension installed from the Marketplace,
note that there is no need to uninstall it for development as it is
automatically
replaced when the `Launch Client` instance is running.

<br>
<br>

## Development Setup

1. Clone this repository

2. Open the project in VSCode

3. Install the dependencies

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. In the **VSCode Debug Menu**
   start the `Launch Client` task

5. In the **VSCode Debug Menu**
   use the restart button after you
   have made changes to reload

## Pull Requests

Once you are ready to open a ( draft ) pull request, give it a 𝗧𝗶𝘁𝗹𝗲 and
𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 that help people - that don't know of your changes - to
understand what, how and why you did what you did.

_It's helpful to link related [𝗜𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗲𝘀] & [𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀] !_
