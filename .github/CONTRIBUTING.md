## Prerequisites

Most changes & feature enhancements don't require the extension to be  
modified, as the majority of the data used in the extension is supplied by  
the **Deno Language Server** which is integrated into the **[Deno CLI]**.

<br>

If you already have this VSCode extension installed from the Marketplace,  
note that there is no need to uninstall it for development as it is automatically  
replaced when the `Launch Client` instance is running.


<br>
<br>

## Development Setup

1.	Clone this repository

2.	Open the project in VSCode

3.	Install the dependencies

	```sh
	npm install
	```

4.	In the **VSCode Debug Menu**  
	start the `Launch Client` task

5.	In the **VSCode Debug Menu**  
	use the restart button after you  
	have made changes to reload

## Pull Requests

Once you are ready to open a ( draft ) pull request, give it a 𝗧𝗶𝘁𝗹𝗲 and  
𝗗𝗲𝘀𝗰𝗿𝗶𝗽𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 that help people - that don't know of your changes - to  
understand what, how and why you did what you did.

*It's helpful to link related [𝗜𝘀𝘀𝘂𝗲𝘀] & [𝗗𝗶𝘀𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘀𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀] !*
