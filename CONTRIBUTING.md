## How Can I Contribute?

1. If you find a bug, **ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/justjavac/vscode-deno/issues).
2. If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/justjavac/vscode-deno/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**.
3. If you write a patch that fixes a bug, open a new pull request with the patch.
4. If you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one, first you should create a new issue. 
5. When we have finished the discussion, you can create a new feature branch to start your work.
